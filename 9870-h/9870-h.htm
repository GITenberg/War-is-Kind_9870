<br>
<p>
Do not weep, maiden, for war is kind.<br>
Because your lover threw wild hands toward the sky<br>
And the affrighted steed ran on alone,<br>
Do not weep.<br>
War is kind.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Hoarse, booming drums of the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &emsp; &emsp;           regiment,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Little souls who thirst for fight,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       These men were born to drill and die.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       The unexplained glory files above<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &emsp; &emsp;         them,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Great is the battle-god, great, and his<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &emsp; &emsp;          kingdom&mdash;;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       A field where a thousand corpses lie.<br>
<br>
Do not weep, babe, for war is kind.<br>
Because your father tumbled in the yellow<br>
&emsp; &emsp;    trenches,<br>
Raged at his breast, gulped and died,<br>
Do not weep.<br>
War is kind.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Swift blazing flag of the regiment,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Eagle with crest of red and gold,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       These men were born to drill and die.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Point for them the virtue of the slaughter,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;        Make plain to them the excellence of killing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       And a field where a thousand corpses<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &emsp; &emsp;           lie.<br>
<br>
Mother whose heart hung humble as a button<br>
On the bright splendid shroud of your son,<br>
Do not weep.<br>
War is kind.<br>

What says the sea, little shell?<br>
&ldquo;What says the sea?<br>
&ldquo;Long has our brother been silent to us,<br>
&ldquo;Kept his message for the ships,<br>
&ldquo;Awkward ships, stupid ships.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The sea bids you mourn, O Pines,<br>
&ldquo;Sing low in the moonlight.<br>
&ldquo;He sends tale of the land of doom,<br>
&ldquo;Of place where endless falls<br>
&ldquo;A rain of women's tears,<br>
&ldquo;And men in grey robes&mdash;<br>
&ldquo;Men in grey robes&mdash;<br>
&ldquo;Chant the unknown pain.&rdquo;</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>To the maiden<br>
The sea was blue meadow,<br>
Alive with little froth-people<br>
Singing.<br>
<br>
To the sailor, wrecked,<br>
The sea was dead grey walls<br>
Superlative in vacancy,<br>
Upon which nevertheless at fateful time<br>
Was written<br>
The grim hatred of nature.<br></p>
<img alt="(illustration--lyre)" align="bottom" src="images/p19lyre.jpg">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>A little ink more or less!<br>
It surely can't matter?<br>
Even the sky and the opulent sea,<br>
The plains and the hills, aloof,<br>
Hear the uproar of all these books.<br>
But it is only a little ink more or less.<br>
<br>
What?<br>
You define me God with these trinkets?<br>
Can my misery meal on an ordered walking<br>
Of surpliced numskulls?<br>
And a fanfare of lights?<br>
Or even upon the measured pulpitings<br>
Of the familiar false and true?<br>
Is this God?<br>
Where, then is hell?<br>
Show me some bastard mushrooms<br>
Sprung from a pollution of blood.<br>
It is better.<br>
<br>
Where is God?</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever made a just man?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Oh, I have made three,&rdquo; answered<br>
&emsp; &emsp;     God,<br>
&ldquo;But two of them are dead,<br>
&ldquo;And the third&mdash;<br>
&ldquo;Listen! Listen!<br>
&ldquo;And you will hear the thud of his defeat.&rdquo;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>I explain the silvered passing of a ship<br>
&emsp; &emsp;     at night,<br>
The sweep of each sad lost wave,<br>
The dwindling boom of the steel thing's striving,<br>
The little cry of a man to a man,<br>
A shadow falling across the greyer night,<br>
And the sinking of the small star;<br>
<br>
Then the waste, the far waste of waters,<br>
And the soft lashing of black waves<br>
For long and in loneliness.<br>
<br>
Remember, thou, O ship of love,<br>
Thou leavest a far waste of waters,<br>
And the soft lashing of black waves<br>
For long and in loneliness.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard the sunset song of the<br>
&emsp; &emsp;    birches,<br>
&ldquo;A white melody in the silence,<br>
&ldquo;I have seen a quarrel of the pines.<br>
&ldquo;At nightfall<br>
&ldquo;The little grasses have rushed by me<br>
&ldquo;With the wind men.<br>
&ldquo;These things have I lived,&rdquo; quoth the<br>
&emsp; &emsp;   maniac,<br>
&ldquo;Possessing only eyes and ears.<br>
&ldquo;But you&mdash;<br>
&ldquo;You don green spectacles before you look at roses.&rdquo;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Fast rode the knight<br>
With spurs, hot and reeking,<br>
Ever waving an eager sword,<br>
&ldquo;To save my lady!&rdquo;<br>
Fast rode the knight,<br>
And leaped from saddle to war.<br>
Men of steel flickered and gleamed<br>
Like riot of silver lights,<br>
And the gold of the knight's good banner<br>
Still waved on a castle wall.<br>

A horse,<br>
Blowing, staggering, bloody thing,<br>
Forgotten at foot of castle wall.<br>
A horse<br>
Dead at foot of castle wall.</p>

<p>Forth went the candid man<br>
And spoke freely to the wind&mdash;<br>
When he looked about him he was in a far<br>
&emsp; &emsp;   strange country.<br>
<br>
Forth went the candid man<br>
And spoke freely to the stars&mdash;<br>
Yellow light tore sight from his eye.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My good fool,&rdquo; said a learned bystander,<br>
&ldquo;Your operations are mad.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You are too candid,&rdquo; cried the candid man.<br>
And when his stick left the head of the<br>
&emsp; &emsp;   learned bystander<br>
It was two sticks.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>You tell me this is God?<br>
I tell you this is a printed list,<br>
A burning candle and an ass.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>On the desert<br>
A silence from the moon's deepest<br>
&emsp; &emsp;   valley.<br>
Fire rays fall athwart the robes<br>
Of hooded men, squat and dumb.<br>
Before them, a woman<br>
Moves to the blowing of shrill whistles<br>
And distant thunder of drums,<br>
While mystic things, sinuous, dull with<br>
&emsp; &emsp;    terrible color,<br>
Sleepily fondle her body<br>
Or move at her will, swishing stealthily over<br>
&emsp; &emsp;   the sand.<br>
The snakes whisper softly;<br>
The whispering, whispering snakes,<br>
Dreaming and swaying and staring,<br>
But always whispering, softly whispering.<br>
The wind streams from the lone reaches<br>
Of Arabia, solemn with night,<br>
And the wild fire makes shimmer of blood<br>
Over the robes of the hooded men<br>
Squat and dumb.</p>
<img alt="(illustration--a woman)" align="bottom" src="images/p37woman.jpg">
<p> </p>
<img alt="(illustration--stylized leaf)" align="bottom" src="images/p38leaf.jpg">
<br>
<p>Bands of moving bronze, emerald, yellow,<br>
Circle the throat and arms of her,<br>
And over the sands serpents move warily<br>
Slow, menacing and submissive,<br>
Swinging to the whistles and drums,<br>
The whispering, whispering snakes,<br>
Dreaming and swaying and staring,<br>
But always whispering, softly whispering.<br>
The dignity of the accursed;<br>
The glory of slavery, despair, death,<br>
Is in the dance of the whispering snakes.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>A newspaper is a collection of half-injustices<br>
Which, bawled by boys from mile to mile,<br>
Spreads its curious opinion<br>
To a million merciful and sneering men,<br>
While families cuddle the joys of the fireside<br>
When spurred by tale of dire lone agony.<br>
A newspaper is a court<br>
Where every one is kindly and unfairly tried<br>
By a squalor of honest men.<br>
A newspaper is a market<br>
Where wisdom sells its freedom<br>
And melons are crowned by the crowd.<br>
A newspaper is a game<br>
Where his error scores the player victory<br>
While another's skill wins death.<br>
A newspaper is a symbol;<br>
It is fetless life's chronical,<br>
A collection of loud tales<br>
Concentrating eternal stupidities,<br>
That in remote ages lived unhaltered,<br>
Roaming through a fenceless world.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>The wayfarer,<br>
Perceiving the pathway to truth,<br>
Was struck with astonishment.<br>
It was thickly grown with weeds.<br>
&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo; he said,<br>
&ldquo;I see that none has passed here<br>
&ldquo;In a long time.&rdquo;<br>
Later he saw that each weed<br>
Was a singular knife.<br>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he mumbled at last,<br>
&ldquo;Doubtless there are other roads.&rdquo;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>A slant of sun on dull brown walls,<br>
A forgotten sky of bashful blue.<br>
<br>
Toward God a mighty hymn,<br>
A song of collisions and cries,<br>
Rumbling wheels, hoof-beats, bells,<br>
Welcomes, farewells, love-calls, final moans,<br>
Voices of joy, idiocy, warning, despair,<br>
The unknown appeals of brutes,<br>
The chanting of flowers,<br>
The screams of cut trees,<br>
The senseless babble of hens and wise men&mdash;<br>
A cluttered incoherency that says at the<br>
&emsp; &emsp;    stars;<br>
&ldquo;O God, save us!&rdquo;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Once a man clambering to the housetops<br>
Appealed to the heavens.<br>
With a strong voice he called to the deaf<br>
&emsp;    spheres;<br>
A warrior's shout he raised to the suns.<br>
Lo, at last, there was a dot on the clouds,<br>
And&mdash;at last and at last&mdash;<br>
&mdash;God&mdash;the sky was filled with armies.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>There was a man with tongue of wood<br>
Who essayed to sing,<br>
And in truth it was lamentable.<br>
But there was one who heard<br>
The clip-clapper of this tongue of wood<br>
And knew what the man<br>
Wished to sing,<br>
And with that the singer was content.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>The successful man has thrust himself<br>
Through the water of the years,<br>
Reeking wet with mistakes,&mdash;<br>
Bloody mistakes;<br>
Slimed with victories over the lesser,<br>
A figure thankful on the shore of money.<br>
Then, with the bones of fools<br>
He buys silken banners<br>
Limned with his triumphant face;<br>
With the skins of wise men<br>
He buys the trivial bows of all.<br>
Flesh painted with marrow<br>
Contributes a coverlet,<br>
A coverlet for his contented slumber.<br>
In guiltless ignorance, in ignorant guilt,<br>
He delivered his secrets to the riven multitude.<br>
&emsp;  &ldquo;Thus I defended: Thus I wrought.&rdquo;<br>
Complacent, smiling,<br>
He stands heavily on the dead.<br>
Erect on a pillar of skulls<br>
He declaims his trampling of babes;<br>
Smirking, fat, dripping,<br>
He makes speech in guiltless ignorance,<br>
Innocence.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>In the night<br>
Grey heavy clouds muffled the valleys,<br>
And the peaks looked toward God alone.<br>
&emsp;   &ldquo;O Master that movest the wind with a<br>
&emsp; &nbsp;     finger,<br>
&emsp;   &ldquo;Humble, idle, futile peaks are we.<br>
&emsp;   &ldquo;Grant that we may run swiftly across<br>
&emsp; &nbsp;      the world<br>
&emsp;   &ldquo;To huddle in worship at Thy feet.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
In the morning<br>
A noise of men at work came the clear blue miles,<br>
And the little black cities were apparent.<br>
&emsp;   &ldquo;O Master that knowest the meaning of raindrops,<br>
&emsp;   &ldquo;Humble, idle, futile peaks are we.<br>
&emsp;   &ldquo;Give voice to us, we pray, O Lord,<br>
&emsp;   &ldquo;That we may sing Thy goodness to the sun.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
In the evening<br>
The far valleys were sprinkled with tiny lights.<br>
&emsp;  &ldquo;O Master,<br>
&emsp;  &ldquo;Thou that knowest the value of kings and birds,<br>
&emsp;  &ldquo;Thou hast made us humble, idle, futile peaks.<br>
&emsp;  &ldquo;Thous only needest eternal patience;<br>
&emsp;  &ldquo;We bow to Thy wisdom, O Lord&mdash;<br>
&emsp;  &ldquo;Humble, idle, futile peaks.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
In the night<br>
Grey heavy clouds muffles the valleys,<br>
And the peaks looked toward God alone.</p>

<p>The chatter of a death-demon from a tree-top.<br>
<br>
Blood&mdash;blood and torn grass&mdash;<br>
Had marked the rise of his agony&mdash;<br>
This lone hunter.<br>
The grey-green woods impassive<br>
Had watched the threshing of his limbs.<br>
<br>
A canoe with flashing paddle,<br>
A girl with soft searching eyes,<br>
A call: &ldquo;John!&rdquo;<br>

<br>
<p>The impact of a dollar upon the heart<br>
Smiles warm red light,<br>
Sweeping from the hearth rosily upon the<br>
&emsp; &emsp;    white table,<br>
With the hanging cool velvet shadows<br>
Moving softly upon the door.<br>
<br>
The impact of a million dollars<br>
Is a crash of flunkys,<br>
And yawning emblems of Persia<br>
Cheeked against oak, France and a sabre,<br>
The outcry of old beauty<br>
Whored by pimping merchants<br>
To submission before wine and chatter.<br>
Silly rich peasants stamp the carpets of men,<br>
Dead men who dreamed fragrance and light<br>
Into their woof, their lives;<br>
The rug of an honest bear<br>
Under the feet of a cryptic slave<br>
Who speaks always of baubles,<br>
Forgetting state, multitude, work, and state,<br>
Champing and mouthing of hats,<br>
Making ratful squeak of hats,<br>
Hats.</p>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<p>A man said to the universe:<br>
   &ldquo;Sir, I exist!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;However,&rdquo; replied the universe,<br>
&ldquo;The fact has not created in me<br>
&ldquo;A sense of obligation.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>When the prophet, a complacent fat<br>
&emsp; &emsp;   man,<br>
Arrived at the mountain-top,<br>
He cried: &ldquo;Woe to my knowledge!<br>
&ldquo;I intended to see good white lands<br>
&ldquo;And bad black lands,<br>
&ldquo;But the scene is grey.&rdquo;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>There was a land where lived no<br>
&emsp; &emsp;  violets.<br>
A traveller at once demanded: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;<br>
The people told him:<br>
&ldquo;Once the violets of this place spoke thus:<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Until some woman freely give her lover<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;To another woman<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;We will fight in bloody scuffle.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
Sadly the people added:<br>
&ldquo;There are no violets here.&rdquo;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>There was one I met upon the road<br>
Who looked at me with kind eyes.<br>
He said: &ldquo;Show me of your wares.&rdquo;<br>
And I did,<br>
Holding forth one,<br>
He said: &ldquo;It is a sin.&rdquo;<br>
Then I held forth another.<br>
He said: &ldquo;It is a sin.&rdquo;<br>
Then I held forth another.<br>
He said: &ldquo;It is a sin.&rdquo;<br>
And so to the end.<br>
Always He said: &ldquo;It is a sin.&rdquo;<br>
At last, I cried out:<br>
&ldquo;But I have non other.&rdquo;<br>
He looked at me<br>
With kinder eyes.<br>
&ldquo;Poor soul,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Aye, workman, make me a dream,<br>
A dream for my love.<br>
Cunningly weave sunlight,<br>
Breezes, and flowers.<br>
Let it be of the cloth of meadows.<br>
And&mdash;good workman&mdash;<br>
And let there be a man walking thereon.</p>
<img alt="(illustration--man walking)" align="bottom" src="images/manwalk.jpg">

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Each small gleam was a voice,<br>
A lantern voice&mdash;<br>
In little songs of carmine, violet, green, gold.<br>
A chorus of colors came over the water;<br>
The wondrous leaf-shadow no longer wavered,<br>
No pines crooned on the hills,<br>
The blue night was elsewhere a silence,<br>
When the chorus of colors came over the<br>
&emsp; &emsp;     water,<br>
Little songs of carmine, violet, green, gold.<br>
<br>
Small glowing pebbles<br>
Thrown on the dark plane of evening<br>
Sing good ballads of God<br>
And eternity, with soul's rest.<br>
Little priests, little holy fathers,<br>
None can doubt the truth of hour hymning.<br>
When the marvellous chorus comes over the<br>
&emsp; &emsp;     water,<br>
Songs of carmine, violet, green, gold.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>The trees in the garden rained flowers.<br>
Children ran there joyously.<br>
They gathered the flowers<br>
Each to himself.<br>
Now there were some<br>
Who gathered great heaps&mdash;<br>
Having opportunity and skill&mdash;<br>
Until, behold, only chance blossoms<br>
Remained for the feeble.<br>
Then a little spindling tutor<br>
Ran importantly to the father, crying:<br>
&ldquo;Pray, come hither!<br>
&ldquo;See this unjust thing in your garden!&rdquo;<br>
But when the father had surveyed,<br>
He admonished the tutor:<br>
&ldquo;Not so, small sage!<br>
&ldquo;This thing is just.<br>
&ldquo;For, look you,<br>
&ldquo;Are not they who possess the flowers<br>
&ldquo;Stronger, bolder, shrewder<br>
&ldquo;Than they who have none?<br>
&ldquo;Why should the strong&mdash;<br>
&ldquo;The beautiful strong&mdash;<br>
&ldquo;Why should they not have the flowers?<br>
<br>
Upon reflection, the tutor bowed to the<br>
&emsp; &emsp;     ground.<br>
&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he said,<br>
&ldquo;The stars are displaced<br>
&ldquo;By this towering wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

INTRIGUE<br>
<br>
<p>Thou art my love,<br>
And thou art the peace of sundown<br>
When the blue shadows soothe,<br>
And the grasses and the leaves sleep<br>
To the song of the little brooks,<br>
Woe is me.<br>
<br>
Thou art my love,<br>
And thou art a strorm<br>
That breaks black in the sky,<br>
And, sweeping headlong,<br>
Drenches and cowers each tree,<br>
And at the panting end<br>
There is no sound<br>
Save the melancholy cry of a single owl&mdash;<br>
Woe is me!<br>
<br>
Thou are my love,<br>
And thou art a tinsel thing,<br>
And I in my play<br>
Broke thee easily,<br>
And from the little fragments<br>
Arose my long sorrow&mdash;<br>
Woe is me.<br>
<br>
Thou art my love,<br>
And thou art a wary violet,<br>
Drooping from sun-caresses,<br>
Answering mine carelessly&mdash;<br>
Woe is me.</p>
<img alt="(illustration--stylized flower)" align="bottom" src="images/p70flwer.jpg">
<br>
<p>Thou art my love,<br>
And thou art the ashes of other men's love,<br>
And I bury my face in these ashes,<br>
And I love them&mdash;<br>
Woe is me.<br>
<br>
Thou art my love,<br>
And thou art the beard<br>
On another man's face&mdash;<br>
Woe is me.<br>
<br>
Thou art my love,<br>
And thou art a temple,<br>
And in this temple is an altar,<br>
And on this altar is my heart&mdash;<br>
Woe is me.<br>
<br>
Thou art my love,<br>
And thou art a wretch.<br>
Let these sacred love-lies choke thee,<br>
From I am come to where I know your lies<br>
&emsp; &emsp;   as truth<br>
And you truth as lies&mdash;<br>
Woe is me.</p>
<br>

<img alt="(illustration--column)" align="top" src="images/column.jpg">
<br>
<p>Thou art my love,<br>
And thou art a priestess,<br>
And in they hand is a bloody dagger,<br>
And my doom comes to me surely&mdash;<br>
Woe is me.<br>
<br>
Thou art my love,<br>
And thou art a skull with ruby eyes,<br>
And I love thee&mdash;<br>
Woe is me.<br>
<br>
Thou art my love,<br>
And I doubt thee.<br>
And if peace came with thy murder<br>
Then would I murder&mdash;<br>
Woe is me.</p>
<img alt="illustration--happy and sad masks" align="bottom" src="images/masks.jpg">
<br>
<p>Thou art my love,<br>
And thou art death,<br>
Aye, thou art death<br>
Black and yet black,<br>
But I love thee,<br>
I love thee&mdash;<br>
Woe, welcome woe, to me.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Love, forgive me if I wish you grief,<br>
For in your grief<br>
You huddle to my breast,<br>
And for it<br>
Would I pay the price of your grief.<br>
<br>
You walk among men<br>
And all men do not surrender,<br>
And thus I understand<br>
That love reaches his hand<br>
In mercy to me.<br>
<br>
He had your picture in his room,<br>
A scurvy traitor picture,<br>
And he smiled<br>
&mdash;Merely a fat complacence of men who<br>
&emsp; &emsp;   know fine women&mdash;<br>
And thus I divided with him<br>
A part of my love.<br>
<br>
Fool, not to know that thy little shoe<br>
Can make men weep!<br>
&mdash;Some men weep.<br>
I weep and I gnash,<br>
And I love the little shoe,<br>
The little, little shoe.<br>
<br>
God give me medals,<br>
God give me loud honors,<br>
That I may strut before you, sweetheart,<br>
And be worthy of&mdash;<br>
The love I bear you.</p>
<img alt="(illustration--sword" align="bottom" src="images/sword.jpg">
<br>
<p>Now let me crunch you<br>
With full weight of affrighted love.<br>
I doubted you<br>
&mdash;I doubted you&mdash;<br>
And in this short doubting<br>
My love grew like a genie<br>
For my further undoing.<br>
<br>
Beware of my friends,<br>
Be not in speech too civil,<br>
For in all courtesy<br>
My weak heart sees spectres,<br>
Mists of desire<br>
Arising from the lips of my chosen;<br>
Be not civil.<br>
<br>
The flower I gave thee once<br>
Was incident to a stride,<br>
A detail of a gesture,<br>
But search those pale petals<br>
And see engraven thereon<br>
A record of my intention.</p>
<img alt="(illustration--vase of flowers)" align="bottom" src="images/p88vase.jpg">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Ah, God, the way your little finger moved,<br>
As you thrust a bare arm backward<br>
And made play with your hair<br>
And a comb, a silly gilt comb<br>
&mdash;Ah, God&mdash;that I should suffer<br>
Because of the way a little finger moved.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Once I saw thee idly rocking<br>
&mdash;Idly rocking&mdash;<br>
And chattering girlishly to other girls,<br>
Bell-voiced, happy,<br>
Careless with the stout heart of unscarred<br>
&emsp; &emsp;    womanhood,<br>
And life to thee was all light melody.<br>
I thought of the great storms of love as I<br>
&emsp; &emsp;    knew it,<br>
Torn, miserable, and ashamed of my open<br>
&emsp; &emsp;    sorrow,<br>
I thought of the thunders that lived in my<br>
&emsp; &emsp;    head,<br>
And I wish to be an ogre,<br>
And hale and haul my beloved to a castle,<br>
And make her mourn with my mourning.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Tell me why, behind thee,<br>
I see always the shadow of another lover?<br>
Is it real,<br>
Or is this the thrice damned memory of a<br>
&emsp; &emsp;     better happiness?<br>
Plague on him if he be dead,<br>
Plague on him if he be alive&mdash;<br>
A swinish numskull<br>
To intrude his shade<br>
Always between me and my peace!</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>And yet I have seen thee happy with me.<br>
I am no fool<br>
To poll stupidly into iron.<br>
I have heard your quick breaths<br>
And seen your arms writhe toward me;<br>
At those times<br>
&mdash;God help us&mdash;<br>
I was impelled to be a grand knight,<br>
And swagger and snap my fingers,<br>
And explain my mind finely.<br>
Oh, lost sweetheart,<br>
I would that I had not been a grand knight.<br>
I said: &ldquo;Sweetheart.&rdquo;<br>
Thou said'st: &ldquo;Sweetheart.&rdquo;<br>
And we preserved an admirable mimicry<br>
Without heeding the drip of the blood<br>
From my heart.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>I heard thee laugh,<br>
And in this merriment<br>
I defined the measure of my pain;<br>
I knew that I was alone,<br>
Alone with love,<br>
Poor shivering love,<br>
And he, little sprite,<br>
Came to watch with me,<br>
And at midnight,<br>
We were like two creatures by a dead camp-<br>
&emsp; &emsp;    fire.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>I wonder if sometimes in the dusk,<br>
When the brave lights that gild thy<br>
&emsp; &emsp;   evenings<br>
Have not yet been touched with flame,<br>
I wonder if sometimes in the dusk<br>
Thou rememberest a time,<br>
A time when thou loved me<br>
And our love was to thee thy all?<br>
Is the memory rubbish now?<br>
An old gown<br>
Worn in an age of other fashions?<br>
Woe is me, oh, lost one,<br>
For that love is now to me<br>
A supernal dream,<br>
White, white, white with many suns.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Love met me at noonday,<br>
&mdash;Reckless imp,<br>
To leave his shaded nights<br>
And brave the glare,&mdash;<br>
And I saw him then plainly<br>
For a bungler,<br>
A stupid, simpering, eyeless bungler,<br>
Breaking the hearts of brave people<br>
As the snivelling idiot-boy cracks his bowl,<br>
And I cursed him,<br>
Cursed him to and fro, back and forth,<br>
Into all the silly mazes of his mind,<br>
But in the end<br>
He laughed and pointed to my breast,<br>
Where a heart still beat for thee, beloved.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>I have seen thy face aflame<br>
For love of me,<br>
Thy fair arms go mad,<br>
Thy lips tremble and mutter and rave.<br>
And&mdash;surely&mdash;<br>
This should leave a man content?<br>
Thou lovest not me now,<br>
But thou didst love me,<br>
And in loving me once<br>
Thou gavest me an eternal privilege,<br>
For I can think of thee.</p>

Produced by an anonymous Project Gutenberg volunteer.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
